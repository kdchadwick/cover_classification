This set of code generates predictive models of conifer distributions based on VSWIR apparent surface reflectance
over the Department of Energy (DOE) Watershed Function Special Focus Area (WF-FSA).  This code was created as 
part of an effort to 
generate foliar trait maps throughout that region.  A full description of the effort can be found at:



and use of this code should cite that manuscript.
