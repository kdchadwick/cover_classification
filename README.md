# Deep learning models for predicting conifer presence

This set of code generates predictive models of conifer distributions based on VSWIR apparent surface reflectance
collected by the NEON AOP. This code was created as part of an effort to generate foliar trait maps throughout the Department of Energy (DOE) Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (WF-SFA) site in Crested Butte, CO in association with NEON's Assignable Asset program.<br>
